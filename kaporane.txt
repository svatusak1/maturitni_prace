Author: Jakub Svatuška

==============================================================================
Introduction

Kaporane is a compiled procedural mostly structural language builded for 
educational purposes.

SYNTAX

One-line comments are marked with ## at the beginning of the line:

## this is a comment

Multi-line comments are marked as follows ##[[ .... ]]##:

##[[

this 
is 
a multi-line 
commment

##]]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIBLES

type name = value

int counter = 10

they are by default signed

following types are available:

    byte - 8 bits -> −127, +127
    int - 16 bits -> −32767, +32767
    string - space allocated according to the length - immutable
    list - needs to be initialized with specific size and type of all the 
        elementsl; they are of fixed size -> adding an ellement creates a new
        list
            list str[4] animals = ["bear", "cat", "frog", "elephant"]
            list byte[2] coordinates = [4, 8]
        list are indexed as follows:
            str froggy = animals[2] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPERATORS

following arithmetic operators are available:
    
    + addition
    - subtraction
    * multiplication
    : division

comparing operators available:

    < less then
    > greater then
    <= less then or equal
    >= greater then or equal
    == equals
    != does not equal

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FLOW CONTROL

blocks are denoted with curly braces

if (1 < counter):
{
    animals = animals + "bee"
}


loops are range like:

loop (variable to loop on; range; optional step)

## default step is +1

## loops 5 times with i = 0, then 1, then 2, 3, 4
loop (byte i; 0; 5): 
{
    counter = counter + i
}

loop (int i; -2; 7):
{
    counter = counter + i
}

loop (int i; 10; 0; --):
{
    counter = counter + i
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS

function calls are done with bracelets with arguments:

add(3, 5)

foo(1, 4, "kozel")

function declarations are done with the func keyword 
followed by its return type

func char foo(char a, str b, char c):
{
    char res = a + c
    return res
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE CASTING 

is done with predefined functions:

int a = 10

char r = to_char(a)

hidden type casting is not supported
so following will through an error:

int a = 5
char r = a ## Error a is not char
